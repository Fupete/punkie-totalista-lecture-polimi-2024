## On Consistency and Contradictions
<img alt="I draw and play with the color Blu Italia #0066CC" src="https://danieletabellini.com/imgs/iSugIFfYEm-1280.jpeg">


*"Everyone tells you to be consistent. Have a focused portfolio. Specialize. Avoid contradictions..."*

### Embracing Contradictions
- Coming from the '70s
- The beauty of broken bridges
- The power of self-contradiction

### The Duchamp Effect and The Light
> "...putting yourself in self-contradictions just to avoid following your own taste" ‚Äî Marcel Duchamp (via Munari)

> There is a crack in everything. That‚Äôs how the light gets in. ‚Äî Leonard Cohen 

### Beyond Single Styles
- Picasso's periods
- The illustrator's dilemma
- Market vs creativity

### The Punk (Post-Punk) Approach
- London Calling: just started playing, rehearsals, mix
- A certain DIY ethics and enjoy/lead the community process and journey
- Learning quality by destroying brushes and play rehearsals, a lot of 
- Finding light through practice

### On Interpretation
> "In postmodern times, interpretation is no longer about control or truth. It is not about suggesting, playing with ideas, reflecting [...] No single interpretation should be the end of this process, but there should also be no end to interpretation."

> ‚Äî Simanowski, Digital Art and Meaning (2011)
